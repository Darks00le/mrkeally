<h>problems about each house</h>
<p>if we did it in your house rach would beg and beg for the spot and blackmail until you give the spot and luke would spy on you or something but
 if we did it at my house erin would get mad or something and steal them and rosion would just take them trus me i would know
but... if we find a space in nanys to hind them then no one would find them</p>
